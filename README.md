# PONG_dqn
Designed and implemented a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to autonomously learn and play the Atari game Pong. Utilized reinforcement learning principles and convolutional neural networks to process game frames and make decisions.

I was able to successfully train the model to achieve a performance level competitive with human players. The project involved extensive experimentation with hyperparameter tuning and network architecture optimization to enhance learning efficiency and performance.

Programming Languages & Tools: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, Git
